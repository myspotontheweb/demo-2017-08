== What's all the excitement about?

=== Docker standardized the workflow

Containers have been arround for a while

=== All about immutable infrastructure

=== Docker is a packaging standard

=== Why was Docker popular?

* Docker used the rapid provisioning and shared file system of containers  

== Complementary innovations

* Shift to microservice architectures
* 12 factor application recommendations
* Cloud native applications

== The emerging importance of orchestration

Docker focuses on a single machine, running applications reliably at scale is harder
 
* Kubernetes
* Docker Swarm
* Apache Mesos

Going to hear a lot more about Kubernetes, which is leading the pack

=== What good is a scheduler?

. hides the details of resource management and failure handling so its users can focus on application development instead
. operates with very high reliability and availability, and supports applications that do the same
. lets us run workloads across tens of thousands of machines effectively.

== Demo time

. Build an image and deploy it using "docker-compose". How our current DevEnv works
. Build the same image and deploy it to kubernetes. How we're doing production deploys.

[NOTE]
======
Explain some of the reasons why there are two approaches and some ideas on how we plan to converge them.
