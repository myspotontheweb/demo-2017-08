what's the big deal?

== But what did Docker ever do for us?

Container tech existed before Docker

=== Packaging standard

Lighter than a virtual machine image

=== Makes applications portable

Google have been using containers for a long time...

=== Clouds

* Scaling up is hard 
* Applications can be spread across lots of servers

=== Resiliency

* Automate recovery
* Relocatable workloads


=== Efficient workload placement

Datacenter operating system managing container workloads

=== Options for running Docker at scale  

* Kubernetes 
** Borg's little brother, originally called seven of nine!
** Largest developer community
* Docker Swarm
** Competing tech, built into the Docker engine
* Apache Mesos
** Now almost forgotten

== Demo time

. https://github.com/myspotontheweb/demo-2017-08/tree/master/swarm[Docker swarm deploy]
. https://github.com/myspotontheweb/demo-2017-08/tree/master/k8s[Kubernetes deploy]

== Recap

* Hopefully we now  have a high level understanding of:

.. difference between a container and a virtual machine 
.. the impact Docker has had on application packaging and delivery 
.. that the larger challenge is operating containers at scale
